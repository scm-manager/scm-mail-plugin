# HTML Mail Layout

This folder contains the source of the html email layout.
The compiled version can be generated with [mailchimp inline-css](https://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/).
The final version must be placed at `src/main/resources/sonia/scm/mail/layout.mustache`.

The layout is based on [derekpunsalan/responsive-email](https://github.com/derekpunsalan/responsive-email).
